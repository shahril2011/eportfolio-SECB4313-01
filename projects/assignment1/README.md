For this project, the libraries used are numpy, matplotlib and scipy.

Numpy is used for handling arrays.

Matplotlib is used for providing users with the tools and functionality to represent data graphically.

Scipy is used for scientific computing and technical computing. By using the ODEINT function under the scipy library we are able to do ordinary differential equation (ODEs)

All of this libraries exist inside the python environment.
